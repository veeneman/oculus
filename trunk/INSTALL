Oculus Installation How-To

1) Download and Install Bowtie or BWA.

	http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net
	http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net

   Oculus 0.1.0 was tested with bowtie version 0.12.7,
   and BWA version 0.5.9-r16.

2) Download and Install Google-Sparehash
   (this is technically optional, but it performs
    significantly better than the C libary hash code)

	http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash

   Oculus 0.1.0 was tested with google-sparsehash version 1.10.

3) Run configure.pl, and supply
   - filepaths for BWA and/or Bowtie
   - a filepath for google sparse hash's "include" directory
     (nb - in version 2.0.2 this is [sparsehash home]/src)

   configure.pl will generate a makefile and a C
   header file, indicating paths to your installed
   libraries.

4) Run 'make'.
