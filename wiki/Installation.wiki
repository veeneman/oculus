===1. Install an Aligner===
Oculus is currently configured to support BWA and Bowtie, which are available here:

  * http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net
  * http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net

Oculus 0.1.1 was tested with bowtie version 0.12.7, and BWA version 0.5.9-`r16`.

===2. Download and Install Google SpareHash (Optional)===
Oculus can compile with either standard library maps, or Google SparseHash maps, which are faster and use significantly less memory.

  * http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash

Oculus 0.1.1 was tested with google-sparsehash version 1.10.

===3. Configure Oculus===
Run configure.pl, and supply filepaths to
  * BWA and/or Bowtie's executables
  * Google Sparse Hash's `include` directory

configure.pl will generate a makefile and a C header file, indicating paths to your installed libraries.

===4. Run 'make'===
