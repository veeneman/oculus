        http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net

   Oculus 0.1.0 was tested with bowtie version 0.12.7,
   and BWA version 0.5.9-r16.

  #Download and Install Google-Sparehash
   (this is technically optional, but it performs
    significantly better than the C libary hash code)

        http://code.google.com/p/google-sparsehash

   Oculus 0.1.0 was tested with google-sparsehash version 1.10.

  #Run configure.pl, and supply
   - filepaths for BWA and/or Bowtie
   - a filepath for google sparse hash's "include" directory

   configure.pl will generate a makefile and a C
   header file, indicating paths to your installed
   libraries.

  #Run 'make'.
